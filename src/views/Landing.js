        Doctor Owl are standing around the bed with the dead body of Mr. Smith.
        Your partner who arrived early on the scene gives you a rundown of the
        suspects: Elizabeth the wife of the deceased, Bill his butler and Doctor
        Owl their family doctor for the last 5 years.
        <br />
        Autopsy report says Smith was choked to death. However, the only person
        next to the body when it was found was Elizabeth, who lay there crying.
        <br />
        Bill recalls Mr. Smith calling the doctor over as he suffered from a
        severe chest pain. But Doctor Owl's car arrived at the mansion half an
        hour earlier than the body was discovered.
